# Play Area
- Moving from R to Py for data/analytics
- Other stuff as we go 

# Learning Analytics with Py

Transitioning from R to Python. 

Done several projects over the last 3 years in R. 
- Will put those up eventually in an R section 

For now, (re)learning using Python. This is my learning space. 
- Will move the good stuff into a more 'usable' repo 

```
def learn(old_assumptions):
	try: 
		reuse( old_assumptions.best_practices )
		refresh( old_assumptions.theory )
		use( store( lesson(old_assumptions) ) )
	catch e: 
		fail_fast.kudos() 
		use( store( lesson(e) ) )
	return( learn( old_assumptions.next ) )
```
